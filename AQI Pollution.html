									<h2>Introduction</h2>
								</header>
								<pr><font size='5'>The data analyst project for portfolio aims to explore and analyze the 
									relationship between various meteorological factors and air quality using regression analysis. 
									The dataset includes several variables related to weather conditions and air pollution levels. 
									The variables include Average Temperature (°C), Maximum temperature (°C), Minimum temperature (°C),
									 Atmospheric pressure at sea level (hPa), Average relative humidity (%), Average visibility (Km), 
									 Average wind speed (Km/h), Maximum sustained wind speed (Km/h), and PM2.5 Air Quality Index (AQI) data.
									 Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to identify and quantify the relationship between a 
									 dependent variable (in this case, PM2.5 AQI) and one or more independent variables (meteorological factors). By applying regression analysis to this dataset, we aim to understand how meteorological factors influence air quality and to develop a regression model that can predict PM2.5 AQI based on the given meteorological variables.

										<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
									</header>
									<pr><font size='5'>➢ The portfolio data analyst project focuses on exploring the relationship between meteorological factors and air quality using regression analysis.
										<br>➢ By analyzing a dataset containing variables such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed, we aim to understand the impact of these factors on PM2.5 Air Quality Index (AQI).
										<br>➢ Our objective is to develop a regression model that predicts PM2.5 AQI based on the provided meteorological variables, offering insights into the influence of weather conditions on air pollution levels.</font></pr>

									<pr><font size='5'>➢ 
										Performed comprehensive data wrangling tasks, including data cleaning and transformation, using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, to ensure high-quality and consistent data. <br>
										➢ Utilized regression analysis techniques, including fitting and evaluating regression models, to quantify the impact of meteorological variables on the PM2.5 Air Quality Index (AQI) and develop a predictive model for air quality assessment.<br>

										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									</header>
									<pr><font size='5'>➢ The mean squared error (MSE) values were calculated to assess the accuracy of the models. The simple linear regression model achieved an MSE of 4674.11, while the multiple linear regression model performed slightly better with an MSE of 3909.015. 
										<br>➢ Similarly, the simple polynomial regression model had an MSE of 4283.53, while the multiple polynomial regression model exhibited the lowest MSE of 3146.81, indicating its superior predictive ability. Additionally, the R-squared values were examined to determine the proportion of variance explained by the models. 
										<br>➢ The simple linear regression and multiple linear regression models had R-squared values of 0.35 and 0.45 respectively. On the other hand, the simple polynomial regression and multiple polynomial regression models demonstrated higher R-squared values of 0.402 and 0.560, suggesting better fit and greater explanatory power. These findings highlight the significance of employing polynomial regression models for improved predictive accuracy.<br></font></pr>
